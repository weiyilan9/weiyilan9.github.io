During my master's studies, I developed a strong interest in speech synthesis technology, particularly focusing on how to make synthesized speech more natural and expressive. My research was partly inspired by an important linguistic phenomenon: in sentences, different stress placements lead to different meanings. For example, in the sentence "I don't think she should get that job":

- Emphasizing "**I** don't think she should get that job" suggests the speaker may have a different opinion from others.
- Emphasizing "I don't think **she** should get that job" suggests the speaker is comparing her to other candidates.
- Emphasizing "I don't think she should get **that** job" suggests the speaker thinks she might be suitable for other jobs.

Inspired by this, my thesis proposed an innovative method for multi-effect speech synthesis by precisely modifying training files and corresponding audio data, enabling the FastSpeech2 model to more accurately reproduce dynamic changes in speech rate, intonation, and voice intensity. Experimental results demonstrated excellent performance across Chinese, English, and Spanish, showcasing good cross-linguistic generalizability.

Currently, I have progressed to doctoral studies in Communication Sciences and Disorders. My research direction has shifted, and I am now primarily using animal models to study the neurological changes in newborns caused by hypoxia. As this is a new research area for me, I am actively exploring the field and have not yet published related works.
